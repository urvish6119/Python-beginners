# This line will print Hello World..(I have used " ")
print("Hello World.. from double quotes")
# This line will print Hello World..(I have used ' ')
print('Hello World.. from single quotes')
# In python it is not necessary to use " " (Double quotes),
# you can always choose weather you want to use double quote(" " )or single quote(' ')
# And you can not write print statement starting with single quote and ending with double quote.
# for example print('Hello World..")
# Also you can not write print statement starting with double quote and ending with single quote.
# for example print("Hello World..')
