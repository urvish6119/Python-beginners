# In python there are math function included.
# For example after installing python, open python IDEL and type 2*2 and press enter, You don't need to define variable
# python supports all operators +,-,*,/ and % to Python on python IDEL.
# The following line will not be print in output.
2+2
# Python takes operators as prefix operations.
x=2+2-3*1
print("X is:",x)
x=2-2+1*3
print("X is:",x)
x=1*3-2+2
print("X is:",x)
# But it also supports "()" strategy, Where you can finish that operation first and after that, related to that operator.
# for example: here it is taking operation (3-1) first and then taking 2*(2).
x=2+2*(3-1)
print("X is:",x)
